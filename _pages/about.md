Alireza Salehy is a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Tehran, where he explores the frontier of vision-language models and anomaly detection. His journey into AI was sparked by a deep curiosity about systems that can generalize learned knowledge to unfamiliar domains—just as humans do. From detecting unseen diseases in medical diagnostics to identifying rare failures in industrial pipelines, this fascination has grown into a focused research interest in building models that are not only powerful but also robust and trustworthy.

Alireza’s work lies at the intersection of foundation models and efficient adaptation. At the CAV Lab and during a research internship at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST), he has developed cutting-edge techniques including Crane, a prompt-learning-based anomaly detection framework that pushes the boundaries of zero-shot generalization.
